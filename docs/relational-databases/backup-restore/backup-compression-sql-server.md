# Backup Compression (SQL Server)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This topic describes the compression of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backups, including restrictions, performance trade-off of compressing backups, the configuration of backup compression, and the compression ratio.  Backup compression is supported on [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] editions: Enterprise, Standard, and Developer.  Every edition of [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and later can restore a compressed backup. 
 
  
##  <a name="Benefits"></a> Benefits  
  
-   Because a compressed backup is smaller than an uncompressed backup of the same data, compressing a backup typically requires less device I/O and therefore usually increases backup speed significantly.  
  
     For more information, see [Performance Impact of Compressing Backups](#PerfImpact), later in this topic.  
  
  
##  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Restrictions  
 The following restrictions apply to compressed backups:  
  
-   Compressed and uncompressed backups cannot co-exist in a media set.  
  
-   Previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot read compressed backups.  
  
-   NTbackups cannot share a tape with compressed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backups.  
  
  
##  <a name="PerfImpact"></a> Performance Impact of Compressing Backups  
 By default, compression significantly increases CPU usage, and the additional CPU consumed by the compression process might adversely impact concurrent operations. Therefore, you might want to create low-priority compressed backups in a session whose CPU usage is limited by[Resource Governor](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor.md). For more information, see [Use Resource Governor to Limit CPU Usage by Backup Compression &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/use-resource-governor-to-limit-cpu-usage-by-backup-compression-transact-sql.md).  
  
 To obtain a good picture of your backup I/O performance, you can isolate the backup I/O to or from devices by evaluating the following sorts of performance counters:  
  
-   Windows I/O performance counters, such as the physical-disk counters  
  
-   The **Device Throughput Bytes/sec** counter of the [SQLServer:Backup Device](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-backup-device-object.md) object  
  
-   The **Backup/Restore Throughput/sec** counter of the [SQLServer:Databases](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-databases-object.md) object  
  
 For information about Windows counters, see Windows help. For information about how to work with SQL Server counters, see [Use SQL Server Objects](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/use-sql-server-objects.md).  
  
   
##  <a name="CompressionRatio"></a> Calculate the Compression Ratio of a Compressed Backup  
 To calculate the compression ratio of a backup, use the values for the backup in the **backup_size** and **compressed_backup_size** columns of the [backupset](../../relational-databases/system-tables/backupset-transact-sql.md) history table, as follows:  
  
 **backup_size**:**compressed_backup_size**  
  
 For example, a 3:1 compression ratio indicates that you are saving about 66% on disk space. To query on these columns, you can use the following Transact-SQL statement:  
  
```sql  
SELECT backup_size/compressed_backup_size FROM msdb..backupset;  
```  
  
 The compression ratio of a compressed backup depends on the data that has been compressed. A variety of factors can impact the compression ratio obtained. Major factors include:  
  
-   The type of data.  
  
     Character data compresses more than other types of data.  
  
-   The consistency of the data among rows on a page.  
  
     Typically, if a page contains several rows in which a field contains the same value, significant compression might occur for that value. In contrast, for a database that contains random data or that contains only one large row per page, a compressed backup would be almost as large as an uncompressed backup.  
  
-   Whether the data is encrypted  
  
     Encrypted data compresses significantly less than equivalent unencrypted data. For example, if data is encrypted at the column level with Always Encrypted, or with other application-level encryption, compressing backups might not reduce the size significantly.

     For more information related to compressing databases encrypted with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), see [Backup compression with TDE](#backup-compression-with-tde).

-   Whether the database is compressed.  
  
     If the database is compressed, compressing backups might not reduce their size by much, if at all.  

## Backup compression with TDE

Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], setting `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` **larger than 65536 (64 KB)** enables an optimized compression algorithm for [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption.md) encrypted databases that first decrypts a page, compresses it, and then encrypts it again. If `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` is not specified, or if `MAXTRANSFERSIZE = 65536` (64 KB) is used, backup compression with TDE encrypted databases directly compresses the encrypted pages, and may not yield good compression ratios. For more information, see [Backup Compression for TDE-enabled Databases](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlcat/2016/06/20/sqlsweet16-episode-1-backup-compression-for-tde-enabled-databases/). The backup must also be in the first position within the media set: when writing to an existing file, the file must be overwritten using `WITH FORMAT` or `WITH INIT`. Appending to an existing media set disables the optimization even if a sufficient `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` is specified.

Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] CU5, setting `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` is no longer required to enable this optimized compression algorithm with TDE. If the backup command is specified `WITH COMPRESSION` or the *backup compression default* server configuration is set to 1, `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` will automatically be increased to 128K to enable the optimized algorithm. If `MAXTRANSFERSIZE` is specified on the backup command with a value > 64K, the provided value will be honored. In other words, SQL Server will never automatically decrease the value, it will only increase it. If you need to back up a TDE encrypted database with `MAXTRANSFERSIZE = 65536`, you must specify `WITH NO_COMPRESSION` or ensure that the *backup compression default* server configuration is set to 0.

For more information, see [BACKUP (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/backup-transact-sql.md).

##  <a name="Allocation"></a> Allocation of Space for the Backup File  
 For compressed backups, the size of the final backup file depends on how compressible the data is, and this is unknown before the backup operation finishes.  Therefore, by default, when backing up a database using compression, the Database Engine uses a pre-allocation algorithm for the backup file. This algorithm pre-allocates a predefined percentage of the size of the database for the backup file. If more space is needed during the backup operation, the Database Engine grows the file. If the final size is less than the allocated space, at the end of the backup operation, the Database Engine shrinks the file to the actual final size of the backup.  
  
 To allow the backup file to grow only as needed to reach its final size, use trace flag 3042. Trace flag 3042 causes the backup operation to bypass the default backup compression pre-allocation algorithm. This trace flag is useful if you need to save on space by allocating only the actual size required for the compressed backup. However, using this trace flag might cause a slight performance penalty (a possible increase in the duration of the backup operation).
